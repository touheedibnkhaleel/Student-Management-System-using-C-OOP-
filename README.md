# Student-Management-System-using-C-OOP-

This project is a console-based Student Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The system includes two main user roles: Admin and Student.

Key features of the system:

Admin Functionalities:

Add, view, and manage student records

Post and manage notices

Review and approve/reject leave requests

Student Functionalities:

Log in using credentials

Update personal profile (email, phone number)

Submit leave requests

View posted notices

The system stores all data in text files to ensure persistence between sessions, mimicking a basic database. The project demonstrates practical implementation of file handling, menu-driven programs, and robust class architecture, making it a solid foundation for beginner-level C++ OOP projects.
